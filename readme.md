# SMPS #

## What is this? ##

This is the source code to "Sound-Source for Mega Drive", more known as SMPS. This is a family of sound drivers used by Sega of Japan and third parties for Mega Drive development.

This repository contains the SMPS 68K source code, with modifications necessary to make it possible to easily build using PsyQ ASM68K.

Currently this is a work in progress. Only the files necessary to build the binary images are included for now, and the code has not been tested in any way yet.  More files will be added as work is done to port them to ASM68K.

The original source code and documentation can be found on [Hiddenpalace](https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Sega_of_Japan_Sound_Documents_and_Source_Code).
